- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly, TensorFlow, LangChain, Requests, BeautifulSoup...
- **Tools**: Jupyter, FastAPI, Pytest, Tableau, Qlik, Streamlit, Docker, GitHub
- **Agile Tools**: Jira, Confluence
- **Cloud**: AWS (data storage, databases).  

## 🔠 Languages

 - **Spanish**: Native
 - **English**: C1 --> [C1 Certificate - Tamara.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/18008899/C1.Certificate.-.Tamara.pdf)

## 🌟 Philosophy and Personal Interests

Every dataset has a story to tell, and my mission is to listen to it and turn it into actionable insights. And what better way to do this than to use mathematics? Here is a reflection of what mathematics means to me and to one of my university classmates, which was part of the speech we gave at graduation (audio in Spanish with English subtitles included):

In my leisure time, I love watching movies and series, reading (especially thrillers), and listening to all kinds of music (with a special love for Dua Lipa). I also I enjoy crafting, being around animals (I’m a big cat lover!), and connecting with nature through walks, hiking, and visiting natural beaches.  

Thanks for stopping by! 😊
